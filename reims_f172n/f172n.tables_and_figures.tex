            % From Reims/Cessna F172N POH:
            Steep Turns       & 95                     \\
            % The Airplane Flying Handbook says to establish "gliding speed"–not
            % any particular "best glide speed." According to Dr. John Lowry's
            % book, Performance of Light Aircraft, "for most (not all) intents
            % and purposes, banking to angle Φ is tantamount to increasing gross
            % weight from W to W / cos Φ." Essentially, banking transforms Vx,
            % Vbg, and Vmd precisely as it does stall speed. In an analysis I
            % performed for the Dakota, I discovered several interesting
            % relationships:
            %   1) Wings-level best glide speed, calculated for aircraft gross
            %      weight, is only 1-2 knots above the stall speed at 45° of
            %      bank.
            %   2) The max gross weight, wings-level best glide speed (e.g.,
            %      what's in the POH) gives an approximate 10 knot margin
            %      against the banked stall speed if flown roughly 400 lbf below
            %      max gross weight.
            %   3) Flying a steep spiral at the max gross weight, wings-level
            %      best glide speed doesn't make sense, even despite the margin.
            %      In a 50° bank, best glide speed increases too. In the Archer,
            %      at 2,150 lbf and 45° of bank, best glide speed is
            %      approximately 86 KCAS. It makes sense to be ahead of L/D max,
            %      so we round up to the nearest 5 knots:
            Steep Spiral      & \fpeval{(ceil(\bankedvspeed{\bestglidespeed}{50} / 10) * 10)} \\
            Chandelles        & 105                     \\
            Lazy Eights       & 105               \\
            Eights on Pylons  & 105                     \\ % Copying Lazy Eights/Chandelles
            \bottomrule
            % TODO: Add accelerated stall entry speed.

    \textbf{Note:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design maneuvering speed ($V_A$) at \num{\grossweight} lbf gross weight is $\approx$ \num{\fpeval{floor(\maneuveringspeed, 1)}} KIAS.
        \item Wings-level best glide speed ($V_{bg}$) at \num{\grossweight} lbf gross weight is $\approx$ \num{\fpeval{ceil(\bestglidespeed, 1)}} KIAS.
